## Data structures
strings: .split(), .toUpperCase(), .endsWith()

Arrays: .join(), slice(), .map(), .sort(), .includes(), .filter(), .flat(), .reduce(), .push()

I suggest everyone interesting in understanding Array methods... to try some of the exercises in delete.js and eval.js files... using console.log to see what's being returned and what changes were made to the example numbers array.  You may be surprised with some of the results. "
