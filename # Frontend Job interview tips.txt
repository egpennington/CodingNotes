## Data structures
**Strings:**
`.split()`, `.toUpperCase()`, `.endsWith()`

**Arrays:**
`.join()`, `slice()`, `.map()`, `.sort()`, `.includes()`, `.filter()`, `.flat()`, `.reduce()`, `.push()`

[js array methods](https://modular.hashnode.dev/rethinking-javascript-array-methods)
> There are currently 43 JavaScript Array methods listed at the MDN website. This discussion includes about 25 of them.

[stackblitz examples](https://stackblitz.com/edit/workshop-js-array-methods-p3-jan2024?file=workshop1%2Fexamples.js)
> In the StackBlitz project, I've included some exercises so you can try 
using some of the Array methods presented in the methods.txt file.  I suggest
everyone interesting in understanding Array methods... to try some of the 
exercises in delete.js and eval.js files... using console.log to see what's 
being returned and what changes were made to the example numbers array.  
You may be surprised with some of the results.
