✅ Step 1: Read With a Purpose (Don’t Skim Randomly)
Before you even read, ask yourself:
- “What problem am I trying to solve right now?”
Don't read the whole page just to finish. You're not trying to learn all events.

In your case:
- “I need to hold the value the user types into my form input so I can send it to the database.”

Now, when you read the doc, you're looking for:
- What does useState return?
- How do I update that value?
- How does the input box connect to that state?

✅ Step 2: Focus on the First Code Example (Always!)
In the React: useState documentation, the very first example shows:

` const [count, setCount] = useState(0); `

** Don’t just read that — ask why:

What is count here?
→ (It’s the current value of the state.)

What is setCount?
→ (It’s the function that updates the state.)

Why 0 inside useState(0)?
→ (That’s the initial value of the state.)

===> Now you’re actively reading instead of skimming.

✅ Step 3: Look for These Sections in Every Doc Page:

| Section Name                         | Why It Matters
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------
| “Returns” or “Parameters”            | Tells you what the function gives back and how to use it.
| “Examples”	                       | Shows real usage, but don’t just copy them — understand why they work.
| “Notes” / “Usage” / “Best Practices” | Often explains common mistakes and how to avoid them.

✅ Step 4: Actively Translate the Docs Into Your Own Words
For example:
After reading this:
` const [count, setCount] = useState(0); `
Say to yourself:
“count is my variable, setCount is the function to change it, and I’m starting at zero.”

✅ Then try it with your problem:

` const [name, setName] = useState(""); `
Say:
“Okay, name holds my user’s name, and setName will update it whenever the user types into the form.”

✅ Step 5: Look for “What Happens If” Questions
While reading:
- “What happens if I call setCount(5)?”
- “Does the component automatically re-render?”
- “What happens if I call useState() without a value?”

This makes you engage with the docs like a teacher, not just a reader.

✅ Final Golden Rule for Docs:
* Don’t try to memorize — try to understand.
* Don’t read the doc to finish it — read it to answer your own questions.
